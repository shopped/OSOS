# Open Source Open Sign (for crashspace.org)

There is a button to indicate if somebody is at crash space, which is a non profit community maker space.

[Picture of button]

When you press the button it will update the website showing that the space is open for the next hour. 

This code repository is the software and hardware information for a sign that will sync to the open status of the space. 

Here is how the sign will look when nobody is at the space.

And if somebody presses the button, the sign will light up and look like this.
